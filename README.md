#Kubernetes_Learning_Demo
This project is my first in-hand learning experience with Kubernetes, where I deployed a web app with MongoDB on Kubernetes using Minikube. The app is containerized using Docker, and I used Kubernetes secrets to manage sensitive data. The app is exposed externally via a NodePort, demonstrating key DevOps skills in container orchestration and deployment on K8s.
